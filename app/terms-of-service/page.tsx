      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        API enables you to programmatically access portions of the Services
        enabling the development of applications. As noted above, any use of the
        API constitutes use of the Services and any use of the API is governed
        by these <a href="/">PatternX</a> Terms of Service. You
        agree to make users of any third-party applications aware of these terms
        via a commercially reasonable manner, and you acknowledge that
        third-party uses of any applications you create from the{" "}
        <a href="/">PatternX</a> API shall be bound by these
        Terms of Service. You agree not to impose any terms or conditions that
        conflict with these Terms of Service on such third-party uses. For the
        avoidance of doubt, materials lawfully uploaded to and made available on{" "}
        <a href="/">PatternX</a> via{" "}
        <a href="/">PatternX</a> API-based applications you
        develop shall be governed by these terms of use.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Additional terms for API usage: PatternX may at its sole discretion
        restrict and limit access to <a href="/">PatternX</a>{" "}
        API calls. You agree to abide by these limitations (such as daily usage
        quotas). You agree not to use methods (such as using multiple IP
        addresses) to get around these limitations. You also agree to make
        reasonable good faith efforts to ensure that others’ uses of any tools
        or software you create that use the{" "}
        <a href="/">PatternX</a> API do not result in any of the
        prohibited uses under these Terms of Service. PatternX LLC, in its sole
        discretion, may at any time change the specifications of or restrict or
        limit access to the APIs. PatternX may suspend or throttle Services
        until we believe the number of API calls will not exceed capacity
        limitations. You will not take steps to circumvent any technical
        measures PatternX may put in place to implement throttling or
        suspension. PatternX reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
        charge fees for use of or access to specific levels of service around
        the <a href="/">PatternX</a> API or any portion of the
        services provided by it. If PatternX decides to charge fees for
        Services, such fees and additional terms and conditions will be
        disclosed to you prior to the effective date when such fees or
        requirements would be imposed. If you do not agree to such charges at
        the time of the fee disclosure, simply discontinue your use of the{" "}
        <a href="/">PatternX</a> API. You may not use any
        portion of the services or data provided to you through the{" "}
        <a href="/">PatternX</a> API to offer any product or
        service that competes with <a href="/">PatternX</a>.

        API Termination: Your license to{" "}
        <a href="/">PatternX</a> APIs under these Terms of
        Service continues until terminated by you or PatternX LLC. You may
        terminate the license by discontinuing use of the APIs. We may terminate
        the license to the APIs without liability at any time for any reason,
        with or without notice. Additionally, your rights to use the APIs will
        terminate immediately if you violate any of the terms and conditions
        herein. Upon expiration or termination of the license granted herein,
        you will discontinue any and all use of the{" "}
        <a href="/">PatternX</a> APIs. You agree that all
        information or data of any kind, whether text, software, code, music or
